\makecvtitle

Software architect with deep experience in a wide variety of areas. Have worked
on bootloaders, operating system kernels, hardware simulators and compilers all
the way up to cloud devops, microservice architectures, data pipelines,
statistical models and machine learning. I find great satisfaction in learning
new technologies and methodologies and to cross pollinate ideas/techniques from
the different areas. 

\section{Professional Experience}
\cventry{Mar, 2018--present}{Chief Scientist}{unitQ}{San Mateo, CA}{}{
Architected and lead the engineering teams that built the
UnitQ Monitor. The Monitor ingests and analyzes public and proprietary user
feedback, e.g. support emails, tweets, app reviews, etc., and identifies bugs in
our customers’ software services reported by their users.
\newline
\newline
\textbf{Highlights}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Build and lead two distributed engineering teams
\begin{itemize}
\item Frontend and Backend - 7 engineers
\item Data Science and Machine Learning - 5 engineers
\end{itemize}
\item Architected, lead and contributed to the implementations of
\begin{itemize}
\item Kubernetes based backend with 15+ micro services
\item Scalable data pipeline including state-of-the-art ML/NLP models
\item Highly available data crawlers for 10+ different data sources
\item Infrastructure as code and CI/CD pipeline
\item Tooling for training ML models on Google AI platform
\end{itemize}
\item Lead the development of several ML/NLP models and algorithms
\begin{itemize}
\item Various BERT based text classification models
\item BERT + human-in-the-loop based text clustering algorithm
\end{itemize}
\item Designed tools, defined and ran processes to manage 10+ humans in the loop
\item Helped raise \$11M series A lead by Gradient Ventures (Google's AI fund)
\end{itemize}
\ \newline
\textbf{Technologies Used}: Kubernetes, Elasticsearch, DynamoDB, Aurora, Kinesis, Terraform, Google AI Platform, Tensorflow 2.0, Huggingface Transformers, scikit-learn, Scala, Python, Java.

\cventry{Oct, 2012 -- Mar, 2018}{Performance Architect}{Samsung}{Austin, TX}{}{
\begin{itemize}
\item Designed and implemented a high-performance, full-system, functional, multicore
simulator for the ARM architecture capable of booting unmodified Linux and
Android software stacks. The simulator was written in C++. I did most of the
initial implementation work including: memory model, interrupt routing, DMA
engine, various device models such as interrupt, block and network device controllers,
and the internal threading model for enabling non-blocking I/O. I also did the Linux
and Android bring-up.
\item Worked on source-to-source compiler, written in Scala, for compiling a pseudo code
description of the ARM instruction set into optimized C++ code used to simulate
instructions in high-performance, multicore CPU model.
\item Developed and maintained user-space tools and Linux drivers for proprietary perfor-
mance monitoring units. Helped configure and tune the kernel and system software
for other teams working with Linux and Android workloads.
\end{itemize}

\cventry{Aug, 2007 -- Dec, 2008}{Software Engineer}{Acumem}{Uppsala, Sweden}{}{
Acumem was founded in 2006 to develop optimization tools for multithreaded programs
using statistical analysis of memory access patterns. I joined the company in an early
stage and worked on the core cache modeling technology for Acumem’s first software
release. Acumem was acquired by Rough Wave Software in 2010.
}

\cventry{Jan, 2007 -- Jun, 2007}{Intern, Software Engineer}{Vmware}{Palo Alto, CA}{}{
Proposed, implemented and evaluated a storage IO bandwidth manager for the ESX
server.
}

\cventry{Jan, 2006 -- Jun, 2006}{Intern, Quality Assurance}{Vmware}{Palo Alto, CA}{}{
Implemented testing framework to test the operation system kernel of the ESX server.
}

\section{Education}
\cventry{Sep, 2007 -- Oct, 2012}{Ph.D.}{Uppsala University}{Uppsala, Sweden}{}{
Computer Architecture\newline
Developed novel methods for software performance analysis on multicore architectures.
The methods provide quantitative data of how applications’ utilize resources in the
memory hierarchy, such as cache capacities and bandwidths. This data has been used
to predict and explain how applications scale with increasing core counts, to determine
how the performance of applications is impacted by resource sharing and to guide
compiler optimizations.

\cventry{Sep, 2001 -- Dec, 2006}{M.Sc.}{Chalmers University of Technology}{Gothenburg, Sweden}{}{
Electrical Engineering and Applied Mathematics
